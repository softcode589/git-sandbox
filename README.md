# Git Sandbox
Start a Git Sandbox where you can do some playing and tinkering with Git.

## Use script
This script is *as of September 2022* Windows-only, however any PR to add Linux and MacOS scripts will be appreciated.

[Get the latest release](https://github.com/softcode589/git-command-starter/releases/latest).

### Install Steps
1. Download the latest release by clicking the link above.
2. Put your Git instance in `%USERPROFILE%/gitcommandstarter`. This is currently what `script.bat` uses.
3. Run!

**Info**: `%USERPROFILE%` is a Windows variable to go directly to your user folder.

This script currently creates a repository that you can test.
